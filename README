App-ZofCMS-Plugin-AutoDump

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that provides means to quickly use L<Data::Dumper>
to dump query parameters hashref as well as ZofCMS Template hashref.

This documentation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>, L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

=head1 HOW TO USE

    plugins => [
        { Sub => 200 },
        { AutoDump => 300 },
    ],

This plugin requires no configuration. To run it simply include it in the list of plugins
to execute with the priority set at the right point of execution line.

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

Plugin assumes that you're using L<CGI::Carp> (should be on by default if you've used
C<zofcms_helper> script to generate site's skeleton). When plugin is run it calls
C<die Dumper [ $q, $t ]> where C<$q> is query parameters hashref and C<$t> is
ZofCMS Template hashef... therefore, in the browser's output the first hashef is the query.
